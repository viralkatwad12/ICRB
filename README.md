## Overview

The Intelligent Code Review Bot leverages advanced AI (using tools like **LangChain** and **LangSmith**) to analyze pull request diffs and automatically generate detailed code review comments. It integrates seamlessly with GitHub, posting feedback directly on pull requests. The bot is designed to be customizable, secure (with options for offline use), and continuously improving through developer feedback.

---

## Features

- **Automated Code Analysis:**  
  Scans pull request diffs for quality issues, potential bugs, and style inconsistencies.

- **Natural Language Feedback:**  
  Uses AI to generate clear, actionable review comments.

- **GitHub Integration:**  
  Automatically posts comments on pull requests via GitHub’s API.

- **Customizable Rules:**  
  Enables configuration of specific review parameters and coding style guidelines.

- **Learning Loop:**  
  Improves its feedback accuracy over time with input from developers.

- **Offline Mode:**  
  Optionally runs in secure or offline environments for sensitive projects.

---

## Architecture

The project is built with a modular design to ensure maintainability and scalability:

- **Webhook Listener:**  
  A Flask/FastAPI server that listens for GitHub webhook events.

- **GitHub API Integration:**  
  Uses libraries like `PyGithub` to fetch pull request details and diffs.

- **AI Module:**  
  Integrates LangChain for context-aware processing of code changes and feedback generation.

- **Feedback Module:**  
  Posts comments on GitHub pull requests and handles labeling or auto-fix suggestions.

- **Monitoring & Logging:**  
  Utilizes tools such as LangSmith to monitor AI performance and incorporate developer feedback for continuous improvement.

## Prerequisites and Conditions

### Prerequisites

- **GitHub Account:**  
  Required to interact with GitHub’s API for managing pull requests and comments.

- **Python 3.7+**  
  The project is developed in Python. Ensure you have Python installed.

- **Required Packages:**  
  All dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt` (e.g., Flask/FastAPI, PyGithub, LangChain).

- **Hosting Environment:**  
  The bot can be deployed on cloud services (e.g., Heroku, AWS) or on a secure on-premise server.

### Conditions for Use

- **Repository Access:**  
  The bot must have proper permissions to access the target GitHub repository.

- **Webhook Setup:**  
  A GitHub webhook must be configured with the correct payload URL and secret.

- **Security:**  
  For deployments in secure environments, ensure that all security practices (e.g., secret management, HTTPS) are followed.

- **Configuration:**  
  Users need to set up required environment variables:
  - `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Your GitHub API token.
  - `GITHUB_SECRET`: The secret token used for validating webhook signatures.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/intelligent-code-review-bot.git
   cd intelligent-code-review-bot
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install flask pygithub python-dotenv langchain langsmith
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**

   Create a `.env` file or export environment variables directly:

   ```bash
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
   export GITHUB_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
   ```

4. **Run the Application:**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

---

## Usage

### Configuring GitHub Webhook

1. In your GitHub repository, navigate to **Settings > Webhooks**.
2. Click **Add webhook**.
3. Set the payload URL to your deployed bot endpoint (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com/webhook`).
4. Choose `application/json` as the content type.
5. Enter your webhook secret (matching `GITHUB_SECRET`).
6. Save the webhook configuration.

### Triggering a Code Review

- **Step 1:** A developer submits or updates a pull request.
- **Step 2:** GitHub sends a webhook event to the bot.
- **Step 3:** The bot validates the event, fetches the pull request diff, and processes the changes.
- **Step 4:** The AI module generates review comments, which are posted directly to the pull request.
- **Step 5:** The developer reviews the feedback and implements necessary changes.

## User Guidance

To ensure a smooth experience with the Intelligent Code Review Bot, follow these additional guidance steps:

### 1. Setting Up Your Environment

- **GitHub Access:**  
  Make sure you have a GitHub account with the necessary permissions to create and manage webhooks.
  
- **Generate Tokens and Secrets:**  
  - Create a GitHub personal access token with repository permissions.
  - Generate a secure secret for your webhook and store it safely.
  
- **Local Setup:**  
  Follow the installation steps to clone the repository, install dependencies, and configure your environment variables. Use a virtual environment if necessary.

### 2. Configuring and Running the Bot

- **Webhook Configuration:**  
  Double-check the payload URL and secret on GitHub. This is crucial for secure communication between GitHub and your bot.
  
- **Local Testing:**  
  Before deploying publicly, run the bot locally to verify that webhook events are processed correctly.
  
- **Debugging:**  
  Use logging and error messages printed in your console to troubleshoot issues. Check your configuration files and environment variables if the bot does not respond as expected.

### 3. Using the Bot in Your Workflow

- **Pull Request Reviews:**  
  Once a pull request is submitted or updated, the bot will automatically process the changes. Check the pull request conversation for AI-generated comments.
  
- **Feedback Loop:**  
  Provide feedback on the AI comments by replying or using any integrated feedback mechanism. This input helps improve the accuracy and relevance of future reviews.
  
- **Iterative Improvement:**  
  Regularly update the bot configuration and retrain or tweak the AI parameters (using LangChain and LangSmith) to better align with your coding standards and project requirements.

### 4. Troubleshooting and FAQs

- **The Bot Isn’t Responding:**  
  - Verify that the webhook URL is correct and accessible.
  - Ensure that the bot server is running and that there are no firewall or network issues.
  - Check that your environment variables (`GITHUB_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_SECRET`) are correctly set.
  
- **Authentication Errors:**  
  - Confirm that your GitHub token has the appropriate permissions.
  - Recheck your webhook secret configuration.
  
- **Unexpected AI Output:**  
  - Review the AI prompt configurations in your code.
  - Provide feedback through the integrated feedback loop to help refine the AI’s responses.

### 5. Seeking Additional Support

- **Documentation:**  
  Refer to the `docs/` folder for more detailed setup instructions, configuration options, and troubleshooting tips.
  
- **Community Support:**  
  Open an issue on GitHub to ask questions, report bugs, or request new features.
